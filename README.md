# SQL-Data-Exploration

As practice in using SQLServer I did this data exploration project using SSMS and SQLServer 2019 Express.
This project is still a work in progress.

The dataset contains records regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and this project mainly focuses on the number of people infected and vaccinated.
It can be found and downloaded [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

First the data needed to be cleaned and split into two tables.
One containing data regarding the number of infected individuals and the second the other of vaccinated individuals.
